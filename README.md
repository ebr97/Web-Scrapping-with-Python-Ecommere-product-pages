# Web-Scrapping-with-Python-Ecommere-product-pages

## Overview

This project fully focused on scraping data from static websites, using Python and the Beautifulsoup4 and requests libraries. This code will not work for dynamically load sites. To scrape this kind of sites need to make an aditional step and use selenium library, where with the help of the webdriver we can render the HTML of the page and parse it to the Beautifulsoup library.

The project is like a first step and the purpose of it is to learn the basics of the scraping.

## A little bit about static websites/web pages

A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application. Static web pages are often HTML documents stored as files in the file system and made available by the web server over HTTP (nevertheless URLs ending with ".html" are not always static).
Static web pages are suitable for content that never or rarely needs to be updated, though modern web template systems are changing this.
